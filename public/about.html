<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I teach preK at City Springs Elementary/Middle. The best part of being teacher is helping shape young minds. 
   The worst part is being hemmed in by expectations that stifle creativity and innovation.</p>

<p>I also love reading, playing games, watching TV/movies, and being in nature.</p>
